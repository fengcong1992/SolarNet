# SolarNet
A repository hosting code for a series of SolarNet papers, as described in:

**SolarNet2.0**: Convolutional Neural Networks for Intra-hour Solar Forecasting Based on Sky Image Sequences

**SolarNet1.1**: SolarNet: A sky image-based deep convolutional neural network for intra-hour solar forecasting

**SolarNet1.0**: SolarNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Solar Forecasting via Sky Images


## How to use
Users can implement the SolarNet by running the GPU-enabled ```SolarNet_SolarForecasting.py``` script. High performance computing resource with GPUs is strongly suggested for implementations with large datasets. An CPU-enabled implementation could be found in a Jupyter notebook ```SolarNet_Implementation_CPU.ipynb```.

### Dataset
The datasets in this repository contains (1) ```Data_3Dyas.pkl```: a file with 3 days of aligned data (1 day of data for each of the training/validation/testing dataset), (2) ```SkyImage_3Days.zip```: 3 days of processed sky images, and (3) ```Data_6Years.pkl```: a file with 6 years of aligned data. Examples in this repository could be replicated with the Data_3Days.pkl and SkyImage_3Days.zip. To implement results with full datasets, sky images and numerical weather measurements should be downloaded and processed first.
