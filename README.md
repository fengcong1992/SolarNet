# SolarNet
A repository hosting code for a series of SolarNet papers.

As described in:

**Convolutional Neural Networks for Intra-hour Solar Forecasting Based on Sky Image Sequences**, Cong Feng, Jie Zhang, Wenqi Zhang, and Bri-Mathias Hodge. (under review)
**SolarNet: A sky image-based deep convolutional neural network for intra-hour solar forecasting**, Cong Feng and Jie Zhang. Solar Energy, 204 (2020), pp.71-78


## How to use
Users can implement the SolarNet by running the SolarNet_SolarForecasting.py script. High performance computing resource with GPUs is strongly suggested.

### Dataset
The example dataset in this repository contains processed and partitioned training, validation, and testing datasets for 10-min-ahead solar forecasting.
